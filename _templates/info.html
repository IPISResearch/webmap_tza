<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
Given the difficulty of gathering precise and accurate geographic and thematic data, these maps will inevitably contain some inaccuracies, and are not comprehensive. <b>All maps on this interactive web map are therefore to be considered indicative only, representing a limited, rather than an exact or exhaustive overview of the geographic and thematic features depicted. </b>Indeed, as incidents shown cannot be considered exhaustive they are not necessarily suited for statistical analysis. A similar caveat applies to the summary statistics of reported fatalities presented in the histogram at the base of the map â€“ whilst indicative these statistics cannot be considered comprehensive.

For a better understanding of the caveats to this map, and further guidance on how it can be used, please see the attendant user guide, available from the IPIS website.
